# Raeen Fatima's Labs 

Hey there! 
Welcome to my personal code repo — a place where I store and track everything I’m learning in Java, Python, C/C++, and DSA.  
This repo is a way for me to practice, grow, and document my learning journey across different programming languages and concepts.

##  What's Inside?

### Languages
- **Java**: OOP, Conditionals, Loops, etc.
- **C/C++**: Basic Syntax, Memory Management, etc.
- **Python**: Python Scripts, Algorithms, Utilities
- **DSA**: Data Structures and Algorithms (Arrays, Linked Lists, Recursion, Sorting, etc.)

### Folder Structure
Java/ → Java practice files (e.g. Calculator, Conditionals, Loops)
c_cpp/ → C/C++ programs (basic syntax and memory concepts)
python/ → Python scripts (learning projects, utilities, etc.)
dsa/ → Data Structures & Algorithms (organized by topic)
