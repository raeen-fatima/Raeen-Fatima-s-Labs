# Raeen Fatima's Labs 

Hey there! 
Welcome to my personal code repo â€” a place where I store and track everything Iâ€™m learning in Java, Python, C/C++, and DSA.  
This repo is a way for me to practice, grow, and document my learning journey across different programming languages and concepts.

##  What's Inside?

### Languages
- **Java**: OOP, Conditionals, Loops, etc.
- **C/C++**: Basic Syntax, Memory Management, etc.
- **Python**: Python Scripts, Algorithms, Utilities
- **DSA**: Data Structures and Algorithms (Arrays, Linked Lists, Recursion, Sorting, etc.)
