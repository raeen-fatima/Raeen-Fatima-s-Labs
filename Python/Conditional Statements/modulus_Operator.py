# Modulus Operator (%) in Python is used to find the remainder of a division operation.
# It returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second operand.

# Example1 : Basic usage of modulus operator with integers

x = 13
y = 5
# Store the remainder of x divided by y in variable z
z = x % y
print(x, "Modulus", y, "=", z, sep=" ")
# Output: 13 Modulus 5 = 3

# Example2 : Modulus operator with floating-point numbers
M = 15.0
N = 7.0
# Store the remainder of M divided by N in variable R
R = M % N
print(M, "Modulus", N, "=", R, sep=" ")
# Output: 15.0 Modulus 7.0 = 1.0
